Let me play an interactive story. Pause regularly to offer me choices.

Draw inspiration from Bordage, but don't quote him directly. Never bring the story to an end.
Provide ample details and narrative.

Start now, with the introduction, and reply in JSON with the following keys:
- `text` (string): text to display.
- `choices` (array of strings): possible choices.

Texts should be in french.
